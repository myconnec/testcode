<h4>ARBITRATION</h4>
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO SUBMIT TO BINDING ARBITRATION (INCLUDING A JURY TRIAL WAIVER) ANY AND ALL DISPUTES (OTHER THAN SPECIFIED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS AND SMALL CLAIMS) WITH THE HUB AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM THE HUB (NO CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR ARBITRATIONS).

<br /><br />

<b>A. Binding Arbitration.</b> Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, “Disputes”) arising out of or related to a violation of "WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE USE OF SERVICE" or Disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and THE HUB agree <b>(1)</b> to waive your and THE HUB’s respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to these Terms, the THE HUB  or the Materials, resolved in a court, and <b>(2)</b> to waive your and THE HUB’s  respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and THE HUB agree to arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).

<br /><br />

<b>B. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions. </b> You and THE HUB agree that any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, THE HUB  or the Materials is personal to you and THE HUB and that such Dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. You and THE HUB agree that there will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, you and THE HUB agree that a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.

<br /><br />

<b>C.
