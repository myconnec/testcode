            <br>
            <p class="style33 style24"><b>1. GENERAL</b></p>

            <p><strong>Connechub, Inc.</strong> provides services through its websites, programs and computer servers, including but not limited to classified advertising. (All such services are referred to collectively herein as &ldquo;Connechub.") By accessing or using Connechub, you are a "user" and you accept and agree to the terms below (the "Posting Terms of Use" or "PTOU") as a legal contract between you and Connechub. The PTOU include and incorporate additional terms ("guidelines") applicable to particular categories or services available on Connechub as set forth to users upon access to such categories or services. Connechub may post changes to the PTOU at any time, and any such changes will be applicable to all subsequent access to or use of Connechub. If you do not accept and agree to all provisions of the PTOU, now or in the future, you may reject the PTOU by immediately terminating all access and use of Connechub, in which case any continuing access or use of Connechub is unauthorized. </p>
            <p>You are also required to comply with, and to ensure compliance with, all laws, ordinances and regulations applicable to your activities on Connechub. Connechub is intended and designed for users 18 years of age and older, and access or use by anyone younger is not authorized. The PTOU grant you a limited, revocable, nonexclusive license to access Connechub and use Connechub, in whole or in part, including but not limited to Connechub intellectual property therein, solely in compliance with the PTOU. </p>
            <p><b>"Connechub&rdquo;</b> is a trademark of Connechub, Inc. and are protected by United States and international laws. The PTOU do not authorize you to use "Connechub," or any similar or related marks for any use pertaining to classified advertising, Internet advertising, social networks, online forums, online communication services or any similar or related use, or any other use that is likely to cause confusion on the part of, to cause mistake by or to deceive the public as to any affiliation, connection, association, origin, sponsorship, approval or endorsement by or with Connechub.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="style33 style24"><b>2. MODERATION</b></p>

            <p>Connechub has the right, but not the obligation, to regulate content (which includes but is not limited to postings, text, code, images, video, binary files, ads, accounts, account information, tag s, emails, messages and any other user communications ("content")) posted to, stored on or transmitted via Connechub &nbsp;by any user (or any other third party in any manner); to regulate conduct (including but not limited to any authorized or unauthorized access to or use of Connechub ) by any user (or any other third party in any manner); and to enforce the PTOU, for any reason and in any manner or by any means that Connechub, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or appropriate (including but not limited to automated and manual screening, blocking, filtering, exclusion from index pages, exclusion from search results, requiring the use of an application programming interface (API), requiring the use of a bulk posting interface, authorization, verification, and the deletion and/or termination of content, accounts and/or all or any use or access). Connechub may, in its sole discretion and without notice, start, stop or modify any regulation or enforcement measures at any time. Connechub action or inaction to regulate content or conduct or to enforce against any potential violation of the PTOU by any user (or any other third party) does not waive Connechub's right to implement or not implement regulation or enforcement measures with respect to any subsequent or similar content, conduct or potential PTOU violation. </p>
            <p>You also understand and agree that any action or inaction by Connechub or any of its directors, officers, stockholders, employees, consultants, agents or representatives (collectively, " Connechub Representatives") to prevent, restrict, redress or regulate content, or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential PTOU violation is undertaken voluntarily and in good faith, and you expressly agree that neither Connechub nor any Connechub Representative shall be liable to you or anyone else for any action or inaction to prevent, restrict, redress, or regulate content, or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential violation of the PTOU.</p>
            <p> Although Connechub Representatives may moderate content, conduct and PTOU compliance on Connechub at Connechub&rsquo;s discretion, Connechub Representatives have no authority to make binding commitments, promises or representations to anyone that they or anyone else on behalf of Connechub will "take care" of any alleged problem or complaint, or that they or anyone else on behalf of Connechub will otherwise stop, cure or prevent any problem, content, conduct or purported PTOU violation from occurring or recurring. Accordingly, you further agree that any representation (written or verbal) by any Connechub Representative (or by anyone else acting on behalf of Connechub or by anyone purportedly acting on behalf of Connechub) that Connechub (including but not limited to any Connechub Representative, anyone else acting on behalf of Connechub, or anyone purportedly acting on behalf of Connechub) would or would not prevent, restrict, redress or regulate content (including, without limitation, screen, block, moderate, review, remove, terminate, delete, edit or otherwise stop, cure or exclude any content), or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential or purported PTOU violation is superseded by this provision and is nonbinding and unenforceable. Specifically, you agree that Connechub, Connechub Representatives and anyone else authorized to act on behalf of Connechub shall in no circumstance be liable as a result of any representation that Connechub, a Connechub Representative or anyone else on behalf of Connechub would or would not restrict or redress any content, conduct or potential or purported PTOU violation. This paragraph may not be modified, waived or released except by a written agreement, dated and signed by Connechub's Chief Executive Officer and dated and signed by the individual or entity to whom the modification, waiver or release is granted. </p>
            <p>Connechub also has the right in its sole discretion to limit, modify, interrupt, suspend or discontinue all or any portions of Connechub at any time without notice. Connechub and Connechub Representatives shall not be liable for any such limitations, modifications, interruptions, suspensions or discontinuance, or any purported losses, harm or damages arising from or related thereto. </p>
            <br>

This indemnification obligation includes payment of any attorneys' fees and costs incurred by Connechub or Connechub Representatives. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="style33 style24"><b>4. POSTING AND ACCOUNTS</b></p>

            <p>This section 4 applies to all uses and users of Connechub, unless Connechub has specifically authorized an exception to a particular term for a particular user in a written agreement. Connechub has sole and absolute discretion to authorize or deny any exception or exceptions to the terms in this section 4.</p>
            <p><strong>a. Postings </strong><br> Connechub is intended and designed as a local service. A user may post content to a single specific category offered on Connechub (see <a href="http://www.Connechub.com"> http://www.Connechub.com </a>) for which that content is most relevant. The same or substantially similar content (for example, an ad for a particular item or service, a particular offer, a particular message or a particular comment) may not be posted to or communicated via more than one such category. Content that is equally relevant to multiple (i.e., more than one) category should not be posted on Connechub. Users may not circumvent any technological measure implemented by Connechub to restrict the manner in which content may be posted on Connechub or to regulate the manner in which content (including but not limited to email) may be transmitted to other users. This prohibition includes, without limitation, a ban on the use of multiple email addresses (created via an email address generator or otherwise); the use of multiple IP addresses (via proxy servers, modem toggling, or otherwise); CAPTCHA circumvention, automation or outsourcing; multiple and/or fraudulent Connechub accounts, including phone-verified accounts; URL shortening, obfuscation or redirection; use of multiple phone lines or phone forwarding for verification; and content obfuscation via HTML techniques, printing text on images, inserting random text or content "spinning." It is expressly prohibited for any third party to post content to Connechub on behalf of another. Users must post content only on their own behalf, and may not permit, enable, induce or encourage any third party to post content for them. It is expressly prohibited to post content to Connechub using any automated means. Users must post all content personally and manually through all steps of the posting process. It is also expressly prohibited for any user to develop, offer, market, sell, distribute or provide an automated means to perform any step of the posting process (in whole or in part). Any user who develops, offers, markets, sells, distributes or provides an automated means to perform any step of the posting process (in whole or in part) shall be responsible and liable to Connechub for each instance of access to Connechub (by any user or other third party) using that automated means. Affiliate marketing is expressly prohibited on Connechub. Users may not post content or communicate with any Connechub user for purposes of affiliate marketing or in connection with any affiliate marketing system, scheme or program in any manner or under any circumstance.</p>
            <p><strong>b. Accounts </strong><br> A user may maintain and use no more than one account to post content. A user specifically may not create or use additional accounts for the purpose of circumventing technological restrictions (security measures) in the posting process or otherwise for posting content in violation of the PTOU. A user may create an account only on his/her own behalf. A user must not permit, enable, induce or encourage others to create accounts for him/her. The creation of accounts for others is expressly prohibited. A user must only use his/her own account, and may not use any account of another. The purchase and sale of accounts is expressly prohibited.</p>
            <p>A user must create his/her account personally and manually and may not create accounts by any automated means. Without limitation, this includes the obligation that the user personally and manually solves any CAPTCHA challenge in the account creation process. The circumvention of any technological restriction or security measure in the account creation process is also expressly prohibited.</p>
            <p><strong>c. Tagging </strong><br> A user shall not "tag" (or otherwise seek removal of) content on Connechub without a personal, good-faith belief that the content violates the PTOU. A user may tag content only on his/her own behalf. A user must not permit, enable, induce or encourage others to tag content for them. A user must not tag content for others. A user may tag a specific item of content only once. A user tagging content must do so manually and may not employ any automated means, products (including, without limitation, software programs) or services to tag content. A user must not circumvent any technological restrictions (security measures) in the tagging process. Without limitation, this prohibition includes a ban on the use of multiple IP addresses for tagging (by use of proxy servers or any means whatsoever).</p>
            <br>
            <p class="style33 style24"><b>5. UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS AND ACTIVITIES</b></p>

            <p>This section 5 applies to all uses and users of Connechub, unless Connechub has specifically authorized an exception to a particular term for a particular user in a written agreement. Connechub has sole and absolute discretion to authorize or deny any exception or exceptions to the terms in this section 5.</p>
            <p>To maintain the integrity and functionality of Connechub for its users, access to Connechub and/or activities related to Connechub &nbsp;that are harmful to, inconsistent with or disruptive of Connechub and/or its users' beneficial use and enjoyment of Connechub are expressly unauthorized and prohibited. For example, without limitation: The collection of Connechub users&rsquo; personal information (including but not limited to email addresses, IP addresses and telephone numbers) is not allowed for any purpose. Any copying, aggregation, display, distribution, performance or derivative use of Connechub or any content posted on Connechub whether done directly or through intermediaries (including but not limited to by means of spiders, robots, crawlers, scrapers, framing, iframes or RSS feeds) is prohibited. As a limited exception, general purpose Internet search engines and noncommercial public archives will be entitled to access Connechub without individual written agreements executed with Connechub that specifically authorize an exception to this prohibition if, in all cases and individual instances: (a) they provide a direct hyperlink to the relevant Connechub website, service, forum or content; (b) they access Connechub &nbsp;from a stable IP address using an easily identifiable agent; and (c) they comply with Connechub's robots.txt file; provided however, that Connechub may terminate this limited exception as to any search engine or public archive (or any person or entity relying on this provision to access Connechub without their own written agreement executed with Connechub), at any time and in its sole discretion, upon written notice, including, without limitation, by email notice.</p>
            <p>Any access to or use of Connechub to design, develop, test, update, operate, modify, maintain, support, market, advertise, distribute or otherwise make available any program, application or service (including, without limitation, any device, technology, product, computer program, mobile device application, website, or mechanical or personal service) that enables or provides access to, use of, operation of or interoperation with Connechub (including, without limitation, to access content, post content, cross-post content, re-post content, respond or reply to content, verify content, transmit content, create accounts, verify accounts, use accounts, circumvent and/or automate technological security measures or restrictions, or tag &nbsp;content) is prohibited. This prohibition specifically applies but is not limited to software, programs, applications and services for use or operation on or by any computer and/or any electronic, wireless and/or mobile device, technology or product that exists now or in the future. If you access Connechub or copy, display, distribute, perform or create derivative works from Connechub webpages or other Connechub intellectual property in violation of the PTOU or for purposes inconsistent with the PTOU, your access, copying, display, distribution, performance or derivative work is unauthorized. Circumvention of any technological restriction or security measure on Connechub or any provision of the PTOU that restricts content, conduct, accounts or access is expressly prohibited. For purposes of this paragraph, you agree that cached copies of Connechub webpages on your computer or computer server constitute "copies" under the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. &sect; 101. For purposes of this paragraph, you further agree that CAPTCHAs and telephone verification are "technological measures" that effectively control access to copyright-protected components and rights of Connechub pursuant to 17 U.S.C. &sect; 1201.</p>
            <p>Any effort to decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer all or any part of Connechub in order to identify, acquire, copy or emulate any source code or object code is expressly prohibited. Any activities (including but not limited to posting voluminous content) that are inconsistent with use of Connechub in compliance with the PTOU or that may impair or interfere with the integrity, functionality, performance, usefulness, usability, signal-to-noise ratio or quality of all or any part of Connechub in any manner are expressly prohibited. Any attempt (whether or not successful) to engage in, or to enable, induce, encourage, cause or assist anyone else to engage in, any of the above unauthorized and prohibited access and activities is also expressly prohibited and is a violation of the PTOU.</p>
