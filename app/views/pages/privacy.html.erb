In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such collection and use of your device’s location, but it may affect the possibility of using the THE HUB.



<br /><br />
  

<b>C.</b>  We may also use any ad you post on THE HUB, including the uploaded photo and/or image as your profile pic or videos as well as other data (including user name and location) associated with the ad, for our own advertising purposes, including social media, Facebook ads, newsletters and ads for any media.
